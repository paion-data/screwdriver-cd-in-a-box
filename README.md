# Screwdriver in a Box

This handy feature will bring up an entire Screwdriver instance (UI, API, and log store) locally
for you to play with. All data written to a database will be stored in `data` directory.

Requires:

- Python 2.7.11+
- [Docker][docker]
- [Docker Compose 1.8.1+][docker-compose]

1. [Login to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login) with your Docker username (not email).
2. Run the below command in your terminal to bring up a Screwdriver cluster locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paion-data/screwdriver-cd-in-a-box
cd screwdriver-cd-in-a-box
python3 setup.py
```

3. You will be prompted to enter your desired SCM provider as well as your Client ID and Client Secret. Afterwards, type `y` to launch Screwdriver!
